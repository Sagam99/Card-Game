# Card-Game
This Card Game is part of my personal project and also a learning project from my Game Development course
to gain a Hands on Experience in Game Development. The project helped to understand the foundation of Object Oriented Programming. 
I was able to learn the methods, class, variables, de-bugging along with attribute creation. 
The project also helped me to get introduced with Unity and its Animation, UI, Game objects, Scenes and Game mode functions.
